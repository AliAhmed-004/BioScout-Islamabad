Over 200 species of indigenous medicinal plants have been documented in the Margalla Hills, including *Bergenia ciliata*, *Adhatoda vasica*, and *Podophyllum hexandrum*. These plants are traditionally used in Unani and Ayurvedic systems of medicine. However, many are under pressure due to overharvesting and habitat degradation. WWF-Pakistan advocates for sustainable harvesting practices and community-led conservation to protect this botanical heritage.
