The Asian Paradise Flycatcher (Terpsiphone paradisi) is a summer migrant bird found in the forested areas of Islamabad and the lower Himalayas. Recognized by its long tail and striking plumage, it breeds in tree hollows between April and July. Conservationists emphasize the importance of preserving native broadleaf tree species, as they provide crucial nesting habitats for this insectivorous bird.
